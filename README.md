Notes Keeper is a simple and efficient note-taking application developed using React. The app provides users with a platform to create, manage, and organize their notes effectively. The focus is on delivering a clean and intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to keep track of their thoughts and tasks.

# Purpose and Goal:
The primary purpose of developing Notes Keeper was to build a practical tool that showcases my skills in React development. The goals of the project were to:

Demonstrate my proficiency in building functional web applications with React.
Create a user-friendly note-taking app that addresses common user needs.
Implement core features such as adding, and deleting notes.
Ensure the application is responsive and accessible on various devices.

#Web Stack and Explanation:
React: Used for building the user interface and managing the component state.

Local Storage: Implemented to save notes locally on the user's device, ensuring data persistence across sessions.
Problems and Thought Process:

# State Management: Managing the state of notes, including adding, editing, and deleting, required careful planning. I used React's state management capabilities to ensure a smooth user experience.
# Responsive Design: Ensuring the app works seamlessly on different devices was crucial. I used CSS to create a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes.
# User Experience: Providing a simple and intuitive user interface was a primary focus. I aimed to minimize the number of steps needed to perform core actions, making the app easy to use.

# This project highlights my ability to develop practical and user-friendly web applications using React. It demonstrates my skills in component management, state handling, responsive design, and ensuring data persistence.
